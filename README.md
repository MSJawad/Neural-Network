# Neural-Network
Just a simple neural network I built. Working to expand my knowledge on the subject and progress to multi layer perceptrons


## Language(s) used:
Python

## Overview

Neural Networks are a foundation upon which Data Science is built one. They come in layers of
inputs and after giving your model some training values based on your set of rules and training 
it against it's output, it will be trained against those inputs for a number of iterations and then 
will be able to accurately predict outputs for a number of inputs, based on the same rules.
As long as the rule given is a linearly seperable problem, a single perceptron will be able to
give accurate results 

## Dependancies
